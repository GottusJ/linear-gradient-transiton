# CSS Linear Gradient Transition
This repository contains a basic CSS file that can be used to create a linear gradient transition.

## Description
This CSS file allows developers to create a linear gradient transition effect on any HTML element. The transition effect is created using CSS3 linear gradient properties, which can be customized to achieve different colors and angles.

## Usage
To use the CSS file, simply include it in your HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section. Then, add the linear-transition class to any HTML element you want to apply the transition effect to.

## Customization
The CSS file contains several variables that can be customized to achieve different gradient colors and angles. The variables are located at the top of the CSS file and include:

--primary: The starting color of the gradient.
--secondary: The ending color of the gradient.
--third: The middle color of the gradient.
  
To customize these variables, simply change the value to the desired color or angle.
